Creating a Three.js scene is already super simple with R3F, but itâ€™s going to get even simpler with DREI
let's add orbit control (or other controls):

    import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei'

    in return add this > 
        <OrbitControls />

it's done, very easy. right? for control over more options for example: 
    <OrbitControls enableDamping={ false } />  turn off the Damping for no smooth animations.
