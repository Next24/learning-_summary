4- Normalize scales: in object mode select all objects with A > press Ctrl+A to open the Apply menu 
  and choose Scale. You can't see a difference, but all of the object scales have been applied to their

  Press U > Unwarp > go to Edge select > select the cutting edges > U > Mark Seam > Ctrl + L > U > Unwarp
