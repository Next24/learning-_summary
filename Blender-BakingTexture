After creating a scene:
change the renderer to Cycles and one of the previews to render view by pressing Z and 
  selecting Rendered.
to create lighting objects select the Emission Material, change the Color, and set the Strength. 
  remove other lights and add an Area Light to have light control.


1- Optimization: Removing hidden faces
2- position check for Z-fighting 
3- Fixing faces orientation
4- Normalize scales: in object mode select all objects with A > press Ctrl+A to open the Apply menu 
  and choose Scale. You can't see a difference, but all of the object scales have been applied to their 
  geometries instead. This way, all our objects now have a scale of 1.
5- create or open the UV Editor area > select the object > go to Edit Mode > A or Ctrl + L to select island
  Press U > Unwarp > go to Edge select > select the cutting edges > U > Mark Seam > Ctrl + L > U > Unwarp 
  you can set the Margin for object parts with the Unwrap menu (bottom left corner)
6- for small scenes with few small objects you can put all of the UVs on the same plane and bake them all together. 
  for this purpose, you need to arrange the UVd and make enough margin space, then open the "show overlay" by 
  clicking on the top right icon (to circles), and then the side arrow to show more options. In the menu that 
  should open, check Display Stretch and change it to Area. now change the scale of UVs (each object separately) to get
  close colors and put them all in the UV square area.
7- Once you're happy with the result, you can deactivate the Display Stretch. now we can start to bake it:
   a) creating the texture: Leave the Edit Mode. On the top of the area, click on + New button > on New Image menu parameters>
      set name, W & H maximum 4096, for color Use a white tint, don't need alpha, Generated Type Use Blank, Tiled Unchecked.
      We don't need the texture to repeat itself. Be aware, that you can show any texture as the background of the UV Editor.
      The goal here is to help you see both the UV Mapping and the texture at the same time.
   b) Saving the texture: On the top of the UV Editor area go into Image > Save As (Shift+Alt+S), for File Format Choose 
      Radiance HDR, save in the same folder as your .blend file.
   c) Preparing the materials: select one object that you want to relate to the created texture file, change one of the viewports 
      to the "Shader Editor", If you can't see two nodes make sure "Use Nodes" on the top part of the area is checked, press 
      SHIFT + A while hovering Shader Editor area, navigate to Texture > Image Texture, Click on the drop-down image icon 
      and choose our baked texture, in the Properties area go to "Render Properties" tab then in the "Bake section", for Bake Type
      select "Combined", for margin if the result wasn't over lapping stay at 16, uncheck "Clear Image" if you bake step by step,
      Before bake, choose a Sampling quality 256 because we will fix the visual noise later, now bake.
