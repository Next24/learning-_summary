*******

X: delete & dissolve (object, faces, edges, vertex)
G: move objects (or transform parts) (position and rotation in object mode to not change the anchor point)
R: rotate
S: scale (change in edit mode to not change the object scale of 1)
E: extrude 
Shift+D: duplicate
k: Knife 
M: move to collection
I: insert (faces)
find the wrong faces: small arrow for viewport overlay > face orientation (red = wrong / blue = right) > go to edit mode > select faces > Alt + N (to flip the face)
