shortcuts and summary path to achieve a targeted object

*******

X: delete & dissolve (object, faces, edges, vertex).
G: move objects (or transform parts) (position and rotation in object mode to not change the anchor point).
R: rotate.
S: scale (change in edit mode to not change the object scale of 1).
E: extrude.
Shift+D: duplicate.
k: Knife.
M: move to collection.
I: insert (faces).
to find the wrong faces: small arrow for viewport overlay > face orientation (red=wrong, blue=correct) > go to edit mode > select faces > Alt + N (to flip the face).
P: separate selected to a new object.
to change the pivot point (even when the mirror modifier is on): go to vertex selection mode (1 key) > select front and back desired vertexes > Shift + S > cursor to selected > object mode > Tab on selected object > set origin > set origin to 3D cursor.
